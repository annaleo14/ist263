        <p>My name is Anna Leonido. I am currently majoring in Computer Science, with an interest in specializing in Cyber Security. I have experience coding
        in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL and Python from taking classes in high school and further my studies at Syracuse University. I have learned
        effective ways to problem solve, while staying on task and getting them done in a timely manner.

        Outside of being a full-time student, one of the hobbies I have taken up is photography. Capturing a certain view of the world around me is something
        that has always interested me. Being able to share that view with people is something that I love to do because I feel it is important to express
        yourself, so people get to know you. My current favorite tv show is a tie between “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” Both shows
        bring equally intriguing stories that drew me in from the first episode I watched. Aside from watching a fair amount of tv shows, I also love to read
        to fill my time. My favorite genre of books are murder mystery novels. The suspense and growing plot of each book grabs my attention and pulls me into
        going back for more.

        Getting a bit more personal, I am an only child to two Computer Scientists, which is how my interest in Computer Science was sparked. Growing up with
        parents who code for their jobs, I became interested in what they were doing and that’s where my journey began. While in elementary/middle school, I
        experimented with learning to code off Khan Academy, an academic resource website that has extra practice for any subject you could think of. When I
        got to high school, I recognized my interest in coding and exploring more of the coding world, taking classes all four years of my high school career.
        Now I am in college, continuing to follow my interest in Computer Science, with the hope of getting a career out of it. I am grateful to have the
        opportunity to follow my interests and pursue a higher education!!
