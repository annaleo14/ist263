            <p id="skip">This month's photo was taken at a local park in my hometown, Rockland County, New York. I took this photo because I saw the couple sitting on the bench and thought it was a good shot, along with simply capturing what I see in the world around me. These photos that I have taken are meant to show people how I see in the world, as well as the want to showcase its beauty. To see more photos, including this one, please click on the links <a href="#skip" class="skip">here</a> to explore more of my work!!</p>
