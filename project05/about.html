            <p>Hey, my name is Anna Leonido and I am the photogrpaher behind this website!! I first got into photography when I was younger, watching my dad take pictures with is Nikon camera for every major milestone or school event in my life. Soon after, I started taking some pictures with his camera, until my parents bought me my first digital camera. I took that camera almost everywhere, capturing everything I saw around me in a picture. My silly picutres turned into a hobby of mine, eventually growing into something I used as a way of expressing myself to other people. My junior year of high school, I took photography lessons to learn how to expand my knowledge of photography so I could better showcases my perspective of the world around me to anyone who would see my collection of photos. Everyone has a unique eye, style and perspective, which makes art (especially photography) so interesting. I hope these photos help you see the world through my eyes. Thank you for taking the time to be interested in my point of view and unique way of showcasing one of my interests!!</p>
